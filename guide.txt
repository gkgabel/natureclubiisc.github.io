1.Adding New Events
To add a new event to the website, you need to create a new markdown file in the _events directory at the root of the project. The name of the file should match the link field you want for your event. For example, for an event with link: 'event1.html', create a file named event1.md.

Here's the structure of an event markdown file:(excluding ```)

```
---
layout: article 
title: "Event Title"
one_line_detail: "Short description of the event"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
---

Additional content for the event.

```

Here's what each field represents:

layout: The layout to use for the event page. This should usually be default, unless you have created a custom layout for your event pages.
title: The title of the event. This will be displayed as the heading of the event card on the website.
one_line_detail: A short description or summary of the event. This will be displayed on the event card under the title.
date: The date of the event, in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
The content below the front matter (front matter is the part between the --- lines) will be the main content of the event page.
