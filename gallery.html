    Get all "photo_set" pages and display a list with links to them.
    Please don't change anything here.
    To add a new photo set:
    1. Create a new html file example_name.html in this same directory. berlin.html here is one such example.
    2. Copy the contents similar to berlin.html. There size argument tells the number of photos to display
    3. Now go to directory images/photos and put the photos to be displayed and name them as example_name_1,..example_name_n
    You will be able to see your new photo set listed once you refresh the page
